        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</strong></p>
        <p>Manna is primarily an offline application. However, we use a limited third-party service (RevenueCat) solely for validating in-app purchases.</p>

        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. In-App Purchases</h2>

            <li>Custom background images</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>6.1 Payment Processing</h3>

        <h3>6.2 Purchase Management Service (RevenueCat)</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Anonymous device identifier (not linked to your personal identity)</li>
            <li>Purchase receipt data from Apple (to verify your purchase)</li>
            <li>App version and platform information</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> RevenueCat does NOT have access to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your payment information (credit card, billing address, etc. - handled exclusively by Apple)</li>
            <li>Your Bible reading data or any content you enter in the app</li>

        <h2>7. Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not use any tracking technologies.</strong></p>
        <p>Specifically, Manna does NOT use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> We do not access or use your device's advertising identifier (IDFA) or any other device identifiers for tracking purposes</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We do not send or store any cookies on your device</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Since we do not track you in any way, there is no need to opt out of tracking. The app does not respond to Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals because it does not track you in the first place.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Service Providers</h2>

However, given our offline-first design, this scenario is highly unlikely.</p>
